# bamazon

### Overview

Bamazon is a mock store front that is run in the command line. It offers users the options to simulate roles as both customers and a manager. As a customer, the user can simply see the store's inventory and place an order. Once an order is replaced, a bill of sale is returned and the quantity updates in real time. Accessed as a manager, besides showing the storefront the app allows the user to see what specific products have low inventory and order new stock, as well as adding new products to the store complete with unique ids, names, departments, price, and quantity.
